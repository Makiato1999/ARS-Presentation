          <h3><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Description</h3>
          <p>The system will feature a very easy to use search panel that allows travellers to search for flights in real time. They will be able to select their departing and arrival cities of choice accompanied with their airport codes for accuracy in city names allowing the travellers to only be able to see cities that are serviced by the airlines, hence saving time. Travellers will also be able to select their journey type from either round trips or one way trips with an additional feature of multi-cities trip in the future releases. The system will allow the traveller to select the dates of departure and arrival in a very easy to see calendar view. They will also be able to include the number and type of travellers i.e., infants, children and adults.<br><br>With these features the system will be able to display all the available flights tailored to the travellers requirements and arrange the flights from cheapest to most expensive to ease the travellers flight making decision. Once the traveller selects a flight of choice they will finalize the booking process by entering their personal information and will be prompted to proceed with payment which will direct the traveller to that airline's final reservation page ensuring secure transactions as they enter their payment information. Once the transaction is complete they will be able to receive their flight reservation information and itinerary. This information will be displayed on the system for future reference by the traveller.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Audience</h3>
          <p>The ARS is primarily designed for airline travellers who need to be able to make travel plans anytime without the need of going to a travel agency or making bookings at constrained business hours at fixed locations. The ARS will be featuring domestic flights within Canada in its initial release featuring WestJet and Air Canada since these are the nation’s major airlines. There will be the possibility of expansion to include other domestic airlines and also an expansion to account for international flights as well in future releases.</p>

              <h3><i class="fas fa-money-bill"></i> Why is cook-eBook valuable?</h3>
              <p>cook-eBook is a significant improvement over more traditional methods of recipe storage (such as handwritten binders or boxes of recipes). cook-eBook includes modern features such as searching and filtering to make finding recipes much quicker. An additional benefit to a digital collection of recipes is the reliability that comes along with it. With a traditional recipe storage method, there is a very real possibility of misplacing a recipe. With cook-eBook, the only way to misplace a recipe would be if it was manually deleted. cook-eBook also improves on the aspect of shareability, as people who have never seen or made this recipe before can view an image of the result to help them with choosing or following a recipe. Accessibility is also a key feature to cook-eBook which is why it was designed with a feature that will read the recipe out loud to the user. This could benefit either individuals who may not be able to read the recipe traditionally or be a convenience to a typical user while making a recipe.</p>
    
              <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> How will the success be measured</h3>
              <p>cook-eBook’s success will be measured based on a number of goals. The first goal would be for users to find cook-eBook more efficient than a traditional recipe collection method when comparing the two. The second goal would be for users to find the recipe sharing functionality easy and simple. Lastly, the overall goal is for the app to be so intuitive that the simplicity and ease of use rivals simply writing a recipe on a piece of paper.</p>

      <h2>Postmortem</h2>

      <h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
      <p>
        The development process was successful in that the team was able to efficiently work together and complete tasks.
        There was good communication and engagement throughout the team on features, merge requests, and errors. 
        Each member of the team contributed in a meaningful way and everyone was able to pull their weight and own a piece of the final product.
      </p>

      <h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
      <p>
        Some areas that could have been improved upon in the development process are merge request size, as well as time management.
        Often our merge requests got very large, and as a result it became difficult to fully grasp the scope of a single merge request.
        This led to both dead code being merged, as well as code with errors in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, time management also became a large obstacle in our development process.
        Due to the entire team being in multiple other classes, the development work often got pushed until the last minute (especially in the 2nd iteration).
        This led to frantic development, which caused its own issues such as rushed merge requests, dead code, and broken tests.
      </p>

      <h3>What took the most time?</h3>
      <p>
        The database ended up taking really long time (possibly more than expected).
        The bulk of the database work was done in iteration two, and it ended up taking many many hours.
        By the time iteration 3 came around, while the database appeared to be functioning normally, there was still bugs and missing functionality which also ended up taking lots of development time.
        In hindsight, allocating more time (or knowing what to expect) would help reduce the stress caused.
      </p>

      <h3>How did the project change?</h3>
      <p>
        The core project idea itself didn't change. We were able to fairly accurately estimate the amount of work we were capable of achieving.
        We were able to implement recipe operations such as add/edit/duplicate/delete.
        We were able to associate user tags to recipes, and also added organizational tools such as filtering on the tags, on favourite recipes, and searching.
      </p>
      <p>
        One feature that didn't make it in the timeline was the ability for a user to upload an image from their device to use it in the app.
        In the future this would be a really valuable feature to add to the app, however it had to be removed due to time constraints.
